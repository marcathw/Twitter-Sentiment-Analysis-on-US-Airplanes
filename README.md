# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis-on-US-Airplanes
This project performs multiclass sentiment classification on tweets about major US airlines to analyze public perception toward airline services. It employs a Random Forest Classifier trained on multiple text representation methods—Bag of Words (BoW), TF-IDF, Word2Vec, GloVe, and FastText—to compare their effectiveness in modeling textual features.
